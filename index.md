I am Bai Yunpeng (白云鹏), currently a third-year PhD candidate at the [Synteraction Lab](https://www.synteraction.org/) at NUS, Singapore, under the supervision of Prof. [Shengdong Zhao](https://shengdongzhao.com/) and Prof. [Antti Oulasvirta](https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/antti-oulasvirta). My research interests lie in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, modeling, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I focus on [Computationally Rational Modeling using Reinforcement Learning](https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517739) and [Heads-Up Computing](https://doi.org/10.1145/3571722). My work involves modeling human users and developing simulations to aid researchers and designers in understanding user behavior and building simulators. This helps enhance efficiency and innovation within the HCI community.

In addition to my primary research areas, I have expertise in signal processing, machine learning (specifically in activity detection), 3D modeling, and manufacturing. I am deeply passionate about engineering and technology.

Originally from [Tai Yuan (太原)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiyuan), [Shan Xi (山西)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi), China -- a city known for its rich history and cultural heritage, including being the birthplace of the Tang Dynasty. I enjoy spending my leisure time playing video games, basketball, and football.
